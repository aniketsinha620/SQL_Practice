Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

 happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

SELECT ROUND(
    (MAX(LONG_W) - MIN(LONG_W)) + (MAX(LAT_N) - MIN(LAT_N)),
    4
) AS Manhattan_Distance
FROM STATION;
