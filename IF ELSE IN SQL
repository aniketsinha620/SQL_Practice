Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.




SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN A <= 0 OR B <= 0 OR C <= 0 OR A + B <= C OR B + C <= A OR A + C <= B THEN 'Not A Triangle'
        WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
        WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
        ELSE 'Scalene'
    END AS Triangle_Type
FROM TRIANGLES;
